title: Why I failed a milestone
---

Hi all!

I've failed to deliver "public alpha" milestone for my GameEngine project. I've found couple of reasons why it happened, despite the fact that I've been on vacation for nearly three weeks. I was distracted by family, and that's totally fine. I still could succeed. I turned in my old laptop and there was time when I was computer-less. The primary PC now is most used for viewing cartoons :) 

I started my job in IBM. I totally switched my technology stack, from .NET to JavaEE. That's funny, but on second day there I succeeded to locate a bug in production. Well, that means I learned well.

In evenings I was too tired to write some code, and watched MasterChef and played [OpenArena](http://www.openarena.ws/smfnews.php) instead. Also, I'm nearly to finish [Android](https://class.coursera.org/android-002) Course from University of Maryland.
