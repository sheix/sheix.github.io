title: And the stories are out
---

Well, I've done this simple job - took everything that was interesting from my old blog and reposted it here, in .pdf format. So, if you know Russian, you may enjoy some nice reading.

And I remember, that it's not all of the stories I ever wrote, somewhere in the near future I will upload here another stories. Couple of hours of retyping them from pages. Or should I give try to OCR?
