title: New side project

My future wife like the game Sonic Jump. It is found on Symbian phones or in flash version. As gnash still can't handle the game from the web, and old nokias are becoming history, I've decided to make a clone of the game. Yes; I know about GNUJump, but I really didn't like the game. Also, I want to work on my Java skills. 
I've wrote some lines of code and opened the project on Github.

Meanwhile I'm working on basic architecture, when it'll be done, it should be continued to fancy graphics and then polishing the gameplay and porting to other devices.

Feel free to join the project and contribute. I'll keep the backlog file up to date.

Meanwhile I'll be low on commits; I'm taking the course and it's taking time. Lectures, home works. Pure fun. Even more than programming :)
