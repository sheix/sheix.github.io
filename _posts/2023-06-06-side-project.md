So, I'm almost stopped posting here. I didn't lost any passion in tech or programming, I just shifted a focus for some time. I returned back to what I really liked since my teens, but never pursued - may be because of lack of confidence, may be because of fear to fail. 

I'm glad to present you my electronic music project: "Simple Not Primitive":

* Electronic relaxing beats

* Funny AI generated cover images

* Some personal stories in descriptions


Read and listen here:  (Oh I needed to make this list before =)

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HbMQ97IyTVQGUBQunvr4a) - from here comes coffee money

[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/simple-not-primitive/) - here is latest releases and bonus materials

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvKynUWYM_wsNwRZ0rbaYdg) - I really need to copy there all of the tracks, but I'm getting notified of my own music

In addition, all the new tracks are posted on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sheihman), [mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@sheix) and [cohost](https://cohost.org/sheix), so you can just follow me there.
