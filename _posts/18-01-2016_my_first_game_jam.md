title: My first game jam
---
In the last time game jams became popular stuff. Some known indie game titles started as different jams entries.

Actually jam is a competition. And I participated first time. As for me I won.

It is first time in my life when I delivered a game. If my life was on Steam, I would get an achievement for this. It's hard to describe how happy I am. Mission completed.

The jam was libGDXjam, and the game was "[Generation Ship][gs]".

It can be described as resource management turn-based strategy. And, it's by no means is no rogue-like. 
I have a lots of thoughts about process

It's about returning home from far far away. 

The game was influenced by FTL:Faster Than Light and Skyshine:Bedlam!.
