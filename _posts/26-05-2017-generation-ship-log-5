And now in details:

First of all, I think it was my crime - to write in Java and provide only Windows binaries. With bit of work, I created Linux and MacOS packages too. They're generated on Windows machine, so may be some magic still be needed to launch them. `chmod +x generation_ship` kind of magic. Due to absense of Mac/Linux computer (Switched to windows 10 since last year) the builds are not throughly tested. If an error occures, please report it back to me so I can make fix for all other users!
