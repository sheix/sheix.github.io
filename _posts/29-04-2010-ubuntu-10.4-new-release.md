title: Ubuntu 10.4 - new release
---

On ubuntu.com the counter has been changed to smiley with "Coming soon" writing. Update manager still doesn't show me an "Upgrade distribution" option. I'll wait a few days before update, I'm sure that repositories will be under heavy load at the very first days after release. Or may be new wonderful Cloud technologies will change it to better performance?
