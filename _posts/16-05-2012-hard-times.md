Have passed. Well, I felt exhausted. Couldn't even be able to bring myself to write a couple of lines for the blog. The wedding preparations, tasks from the work, studies, personal stuff...

Also, the pool was closed. May be this was the reason for my temporal power loss?

Now I'm going back to business. The pool is restavrated after the fire (pool on fire! Thats funny!); wedding preparations show progress; also the NLP course is over. I hope that now, after finishing it, I'll have some time to work on Jump. And have some fun, too.
