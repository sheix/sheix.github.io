title: Silent release of Generation Ship 0.0.4
---
I've just released a version of game to [itch.io][1].


Fixed issues:

- Now the game is always winnable
- Crashed probe now crashes alone
- Messages now fit screen, at least horizontally
- Controls - in additional to +/- added up/down buttons to control probes


Discovered issues:

- End game screen is too fast to see congratulations


Remained issues and vector of development
Release 0.0.5 will be release with bugs fix. I'm going to close all the open bugs. Later on, I should do a balancing - right now the game is too simple. Player given too much resources. There's little incentive to go exploring others planets. Looks like I'm going to adjust initial resources amount, consumption rate and harvested amounts.
