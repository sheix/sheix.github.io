So, We've moved to a new address :). Also got me new e-mail. Another one. One more password to remember. 

I'm new to this stuff, and it wasn't so easy to make redirection from the site to domain. I had to learn about DNS records. But I always welcome the learning of new and useful things. Also, it helped me with the exam on networking at the University, too. 

I keep studying and making my grades better. The last semester is starting in less than two weeks.

Wish me luck :)
