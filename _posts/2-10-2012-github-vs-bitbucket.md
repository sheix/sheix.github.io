Octocat or bucket?

Well, the cat is more cute.

I've read the comparison by the guys out here and as for me the functionality is almost the same. I don't care for pricing either. I think that both services complete each other instead of competition between them. I'll would use the GitHub for opensource projects, and BB have private repos - so be it, something to try to earn some pennies on without revealing the dark secrets to competitors. 

I appreciate the github integration into intellijIdea and I wish that there was a plugin for MonoDevelop too. But there's nothing. Almost. It looks like I'll be doing more Java and less C# at home. That doesn't mean that I like command line interface for git less, I really can handle it, but the plugin keeps things simple for me as a single developer. Pull-Commit-Push cycle implemented really fine in Idea, and it gets the job done.

And the verdict is: The GitHub for all projects, except private ones. There's where BitBucket comes to play.
