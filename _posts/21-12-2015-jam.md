RoboVM declared first of its kind libGDX jam. I was fiddling with a library for a long time, so I decided to take part in it. The theme is not I hoped it to be. We've got "Life in space". I hoped for "Evolution".

On 3rd day I've looked on Mario Zechner's twitter filled with pictures and gifs of other participants. Looks like I'm late on schedule. I have no vacation days, full time job and a family.

I never succeeded to release anything before.

My main issue with finishing is ... Deadline absense. Discipline, lack of it. Procrastination. You name it.

This time I will fight. 

This time I came with a plan. Designed a game on paper. I'll program it and than will do the graphics and sounds and others such. 

Wish me luck.
