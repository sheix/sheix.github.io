title: Yet another update

Seems like I'm starting to count down to the graduation. Finishing some courses, making better grades and going to find a job. Well, one can't be working nights without enjoying it :)

About the studies - I've got to do a lab leaded by Shay Bushinski. Feels cool to learn from a champion, really brilliant man with a lot of knowledge :)
So, mastering my C# skills as for now. 

And it brings me to make a choice - which way to go, where to work? I know both Java and C#, their strengths and weaknesses. And decision is not easy to make... Well. Should learn something new :)

And now, I'll leave for a work out, have a good day too, people :)
