Just wanted to update you all, couple of things have been changed in my life. Actually, in last half year I didn't write a lot here because of daily commute that became an abuse for me. 3 hours a day on the wheel drained all my life out of me. And than I changed my work. I left NCR for good(auto complete suggest: for food) and joined the KLA-Tencor team. I'm pretty excited to learn new stuff, more on semiconductor industry. I hope that I'll learn new programming skills, too, and, in long term, may be another degree.

Now, in the taxi on my way home, I think that was great experience. I really had some harsh time and gave all myself to family and work. I didn't take a vacation between jobs, but anyway somehow I feel that I can take now some time and do more things I like.

I'm working on my music collection, spending time with family, and starting to commit to github.

I really want to raise the frequency of posts here. 

And, btw, I think to give up regular shopping and to shop online. Cash registers aren't my point of interest anymore :)
