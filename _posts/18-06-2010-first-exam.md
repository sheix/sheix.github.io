title: First exam

Machine learning exam was complete fail for me (WTF is Ridge Regression, anyway?), and now I'm going to perform better. Next exam in a couple of days, in a software project management. Now I'm trying to make an order in my brain using mind mapping (Try XMind, it's free). We'll see if this technique will work better than simple rereading of lectures.

I'm still waiting for an answer from One Big Hardware And Software Enterprise, about an interview, and I still hope, that they'd give me a job.

Other stuff that I do for now: jogging at the seaside, preparing small project in ParC(No link for now) and working as usual. I wish there were more jogging and less unfinished work, but fairly, the academic year almost finished and I sure will free some time for any other activities.
