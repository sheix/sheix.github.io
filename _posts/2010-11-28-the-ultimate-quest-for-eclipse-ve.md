title: The Ultimate quest for Eclipse VE
---

VE is visual editor for eclipse. It lets you create GUIs easily(?) for your applications. What's come on naturally in MSVS, demands here some work.

Well, we'll be short:

First, install EMF from http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates

Second, install GEF, address is http://download.eclipse.org/tools/gef/updates/releases/

Third - install VE: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/ve/updates/1.4/
There are 1.3 and 1.5 versions. See which one do you need here.


All of installations are done from Help -> Install New Software menu. Just add the corresponding URL into address bar, click add, choose appropriate package and install it.

This works almost as great as synaptic, but all of the dependencies should be resolved by yourself...

And I wanted to write a great post about Team Working, or GIT usage. But as for now, that's all. We have great things to be done :)
