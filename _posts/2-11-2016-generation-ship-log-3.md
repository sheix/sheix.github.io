So I've released next version of the game, 0.0.5, which includes following improvements:

* Autopilot - now you don't have to navigate manually all the probes
* Resources re-balance - removed duplicate and non-essential to gameplay resources
* Controls are changed - removed manual navigation controls, also moved a lot of functionality to mouse/touch instead of keyboard
* Visited planed are marked
* Relevant information on planets and probes is displayed
* Now game have Windows launcher! 
* Bugs ans typos

And I already started to work on next version. I'm working on technical issues for automating releases and builds in order to make a game accessible on Linux and MacOS. This will include versioning and build script that builds for all supported platforms at once. The 0.0.6 version will not contain much of new content, but will be another bug-fixing and controls improving release.
