title: Generation Ship, Log 1
---
The date is First of February, year 2016. I'm awake from hibernation sleep. And now it's time to work.

Generation ship as it is now lacks. I have list of bugs, and features to implement. I'll write it here and will update as I'm fixing them.
When every item in this list is done, I will re-release it as free version. After that I'm planning Android port. And than - I don't know. Anyway, I'll support it until there are some player base.

Here goes my bugs:
* Sometimes destination is not reachable (03) - the galaxy generation algorithm isn't perfect and once in a while there's star configuration that is impossible to win.
* When probe crashed on planet (06) - all other probes, doesn't matter what their status is, are crashed too. Happy rebuilding.
* Messages are too long (07) - this is simple to fix, right?
* New game should renew all of the stats and regenerate galaxy (08) - this one happened due to quick coding.

And features:
* 01 : Dock command when probe nearby ship (no auto docking)
* 02 : Near detection should be better - landings and docking should be easier
* 03 : More events on planets
* 04 : Events on entering Solar Systems
* 05 : Additional objects 
* 06 : Controls rework
* 07 : Title screen
* 08 : Music and sounds

All of these will enter final version.
