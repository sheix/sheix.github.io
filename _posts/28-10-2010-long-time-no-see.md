So, after a wonderful summer, all the students come back to the University :) So did I, and posting again here.

I have updated the site once again, and, yes, I'm looking for a job. It could be nice new start to try myself in the world of high-tech. It's not only about Software Engineering and Development, I'm also interested in joining some project, I have a load of spare time to contribute. If you want to suggest me to join you at some Open Source projects, I would be happy to participate. And I'm taking another project at the University, actually I have to, but really, I want to. Meanwhile I'll keep it in secret, but it should be pretty cool, when it'll be finished.
