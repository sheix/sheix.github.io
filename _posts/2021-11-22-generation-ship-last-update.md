title: The very last update on generation ship
---

I decided to let it go. I think I've promised it around 2 years ago and I finally did it. I [open-sourced](https://bitbucket.org/anton_sheihman/generation_ship/src/master/) the code for the game.

I still have some work to do there, mostly crediting, adding license and making readme.md file. 

Old friend reminded me why all open-source stuff was so much important back than: so other people may learn from our successes and mistakes. I already wrote about it in the relevant [blog](http://www.sheix.info/why-generation-ship-failed), but it won't be complete without the source code.
