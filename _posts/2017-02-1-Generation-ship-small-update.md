title: Generation Ship - small update
---

This release is delayed a bit. A very long bit, and for no good reason. Oh, may be a good one, I'm not sure.

Actually, there were two reasons.
First of them is long: couple of days I was sick, couple I was tired, couple - just didn't succeeded to write code. I was busy at work, learning completely new stack and framework. I spent time with kids. I learned new unrelated stuff. Second, is that I've started a big refactoring. And I'm finished now, but, the things are not working as they were, so I'm trying to restore the functionality of the Generation Ship, so it could fly to next release. Long one, but it will come...
